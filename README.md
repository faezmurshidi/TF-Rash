# TF RASH - Rash Image Classification using TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computaion. 

This is a model to classify images of different types of rashes.

In this sample we want to differentiate between bed bug and eczema.  

###### *more samples coming soon

## What's in here?

1. Sample images of different type of rashes.
2. Python code to train and classify.




## Instructions.

*Step-by-step instructions is mainly based on here [TensorFlow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0)

Summary:

In this lab, we will be using transfer learning, which means we are starting with a model that has been already trained on another problem. We will then be retraining it on a similar problem. Deep learning from scratch can take days, but transfer learning can be done in short order.

We are going to use the Inception v3 network. Inception v3 is a trained for the [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/) Large Visual Recognition Challenge using the data from 2012, and it can differentiate between 1,000 different classes, like Dalmatian or dishwasher. We will use this same network, but retrain it to tell apart a small number of classes based on our own examples.

What you will learn

- How to install and run TensorFlow Docker images
- How to use Python to train an image classifier
- How to classify images with your trained classifier

What you need

- A basic understanding of Unix commands
- A fast computer running OS X or Linux
- A fair amount of time
